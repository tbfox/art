View this commission as an art challenge. One of my main goals is to collect a
variety of distinct styles, so I'm genuinely interested in what your unique
artistic vision can bring to my collection. Feel free to be creative and push
boundaries if you're inclined, though this is not a strict requirement. If I
enjoy your work and our collaboration process, there's a high probability I'll
want to commission multiple pieces over time, while always being mindful of my
budget.

Thank you for your interest, and I'm genuinely excited to see what you create!
